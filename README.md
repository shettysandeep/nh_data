# Exploring the NH 2567 data
Exploring the spatial and demographic dispersion of nursing home quality across the country. 


## Nursing Home Data.
I use the 2567 inpsections data on nursing home (NH) to obtain some point in time characteristics and health citations data to derive simple measures of quality. 
I augment this data with the aggregate demographic information from  Census. 

The NH 2567 data I extracted ranges from 2018 through 2022. It includes NH charactersitics such as staffing composition, number of beds, occupancy, type of patients. 
This data is collected as part of inspection visits. Each nursing home is surveyed and scored on few a different dimensions of care and adherence to safety standards. 
The failure to meet certain standards in care and management leads to citations.
